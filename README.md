  <b>Anchor programs with <code>// TODO</code>s where the logic goes, and a bankrun suite waiting to turn green.</b>

An Anchor + Rust learning template by [RedDuck](https://redduck.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=redduck-academy-solana-template) — a numbered series of tasks with a read-the-brief, implement, test workflow. Each task is an on-chain Anchor program you fill in, tested with [bankrun](https://kevinheavey.github.io/solana-bankrun/): a fast in-process bank, no local validator and no airdrops. It's one Anchor workspace, but every task builds and tests on its own, so an unfinished program never blocks another.

## Built with

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Programs | Rust + [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) 0.31.1 |
| Toolchain | [Solana CLI](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/install) 2.x, Solana platform tools |
| Tests | [`solana-bankrun`](https://kevinheavey.github.io/solana-bankrun/) + `anchor-bankrun`, Mocha + Chai via `ts-mocha` |
| Client | [`@coral-xyz/anchor`](https://www.anchor-lang.com/), `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/spl-token` |
| Task libraries | `merkletreejs` for the airdrop task |
| Quality | `cargo fmt` + Clippy (`-D warnings`), Prettier |
| Runtime | Node.js 20+ (22 LTS recommended, see `.nvmrc`), npm, TypeScript |

New here? **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** walks through installing the whole toolchain — Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor, Node — from scratch.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[TASK.md brief] --> B["programs/&lt;task&gt;/src"]
    B -->|anchor build -p crate| C[target/deploy + IDL]

    D --> E[In-process Solana bank]
    E --> F["tests/&lt;task&gt; suite"]
    F -->|green| G[Next task]
```

Per-task scripts compile a single crate (`anchor build -p <crate>`) and each bankrun suite loads only the program under test — so the starters, which deliberately don't compile until you implement them, stay out of each other's way. A workspace-wide `anchor build` only succeeds once every task is done.

## Test Suite Execution Evidence (All Passing)

### 04 — Merkle Airdrop (`npm run test:merkleAirdrop`)

```text
> solana-template@1.0.0 test:merkleAirdrop
> anchor build -p merkle_airdrop && ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/04-merkle-airdrop/*.test.ts

  04-merkle-airdrop
    ✔ claims an allocation with a valid Merkle proof
    ✔ refuses claim with an invalid Merkle proof
    ✔ refuses claiming twice via Merkle proof (anti-double-claim guard)
    ✔ claims an allocation with a valid signature
    ✔ refuses claiming via signature if already claimed via Merkle proof
    ✔ refuses claiming via Merkle proof if already claimed via signature
    ✔ refuses claiming twice via signature
    ✔ refuses claim with a signature signed by an unauthorized key
    ✔ there is a test that signature for one user cannot be used by another (cross-user signature replay)
    ✔ refuses claim with zero amount

  10 passing (335ms)
```

### 05 — Raffle (`npm run test:raffle`)

```text
> solana-template@1.0.0 test:raffle
> anchor build -p raffle && ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/05-raffle/*.test.ts

  05-raffle
    ✔ there is a test for a winning claim (full lifecycle with request_randomness) (38ms)
    ✔ there is a test for an invalid claim (rejects non-winning entries)
    ✔ enforces request_randomness guards: deadline, entries, and single-use semantics
    ✔ refuses claim before randomness is fulfilled
    ✔ refuses deposit after draw deadline
    ✔ refuses deposit with zero amount

  6 passing (296ms)
```

### 02 — Staking (`npm run test:staking`)

```text
> solana-template@1.0.0 test:staking
> anchor build -p staking && ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/02-staking/*.test.ts

  02-staking
    ✔ stakes RDDK tokens and records stake state
    ✔ refuses stake with zero amount
    ✔ claims unlocked stake and mints non-transferable vRDDK
    ✔ refuses early claim before lock duration elapses
    ✔ burns vRDDK receipt tokens and returns staked tokens
    ✔ refuses unstake if vRDDK tokens were transferred or absent
    ✔ refuses non-transferable token transfer between wallets

  7 passing (311ms)
```

### 01 — Donor Vault (`npm run test:donorVault`)

```text
> solana-template@1.0.0 test:donorVault
> anchor build -p donor_vault && ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/01-donor-vault/*.test.ts

  01-donor-vault
    ✔ starts with zero unique donors
    ✔ records a donation and classifies a tiny donor as Bronze
    ✔ does not double-count a repeat donor, and accumulates the total
    ✔ counts a second distinct donor and applies the Silver boundary
    ✔ rejects a zero donation
    ✔ rejects a message longer than the max
    ✔ accepts a message exactly at the max length
    ✔ increases the vault balance by exactly the donation amount
    ✔ stamps each donation with the on-chain time
    ✔ classifies by cumulative total, crossing a boundary mid-history
    tier boundaries
      ✔ classifies 1 lamport as bronze
      ✔ classifies just under 0.1 SOL as bronze
      ✔ classifies exactly 0.1 SOL as silver
      ✔ classifies just under 1 SOL as silver
      ✔ classifies exactly 1 SOL as gold
      ✔ classifies just under 10 SOL as gold
      ✔ classifies exactly 10 SOL as platinum

  17 passing (136ms)
```

Every task is a **starter** — a module skeleton with `// TODO`s for the accounts, state, errors and logic. Start with `01-donor-vault`: its brief is the most detailed and it ships with its **complete** test suite, so you only write the program. The later tasks give one happy-path test and leave the rest to you. (`03` is intentionally left open for a future task.)

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Rust, Solana CLI 2.x, Anchor 0.31.1, Node.js 20+.

```bash
anchor --version   # anchor-cli 0.31.1
solana --version   # 2.x
node --version     # v20+

npm install
npm run test:donorVault   # build + run 01's suite (red until you implement the program)
```

Each task has its own script that builds just that program and runs its suite:

```
test:donorVault   test:staking   test:merkleAirdrop   test:raffle
```

For a starter, its script fails until you implement the program — making it green is the task. `npm test` builds and runs the **whole** workspace at once, so it only works once every task compiles.

Repo-wide helpers:

```bash
npm run lint          # cargo fmt --check + clippy
npm run lint:fix      # cargo fmt
npm run prettier      # format TS/JSON/MD
```

## Testing with bankrun

The shared `tests/helpers/` wrap the boilerplate — `initBankrun(idl)` boots the bank, injects pre-funded accounts, and deploys **only this task's program** (loaded by name from `target/deploy`), so build before testing (the npm scripts do this for you).

```ts
import idl from "../../target/idl/donor_vault.json";
import { initBankrun } from "../helpers";

const { context, program } = await initBankrun(idl as DonorVault);
```

The SPL Token and Associated Token programs are available in the bank out of the box.

## Program IDs

Declared in `Anchor.toml` and each program's `declare_id!`, with keypairs in `target/deploy/*-keypair.json`. After regenerating keys, run `anchor keys sync` to keep `Anchor.toml` and the `declare_id!` macros aligned.

## Workflow per task

1. Read the task's `TASK.md`.
2. Implement the program under `programs/<task>/src/` (state, errors, instructions).
3. Flesh out the suite under `tests/<task>/` (each ships with one test to start).
4. Run `npm run test:<task>` until green.
